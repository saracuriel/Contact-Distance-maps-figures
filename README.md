# Contact-Distance-maps-figures
This repository includes the supplementary figures mentioned in my Master's thesis for the resulting contact and distance maps. 

Figure S1. Comparison of the contact maps (A-R) and distance maps (A'-R') for the best outputs of the models that retrieved the best metrics results for the protein HuPrP. Color legend is shown on the right of the figure, where blue represents shorter distances and red indicates longer ones. A predicted output is considered to be the best when it reaches the most similarity to the reference structure out of the total outputs provided for that model and that metric. A model is considered to reach the best results for one metric when its mean value for that metric shows a higher similarity to the corresponding reference structure among the rest of the models. For each graphic x-axis and y-axis both represent the amino acid index.
